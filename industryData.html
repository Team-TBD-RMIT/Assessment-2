        <h4>Software Engineer – Patrick Reyes </h4>
        <p>
            Our teams’ ideal jobs offered quite the variation and each with a unique vision for their future careers.
            The job titles were as follows: Machine Learning Researcher, Senior Project Manager, Front End Web
            Developer, and two Software Engineers. As some of these roles are more specialized positions that didn’t
            offer many useful data that could accurately be portrayed in the Burning Glass Data and other data
            resources, they were categorized into four umbrella Job Titles: Software Engineer, Web Developer, and IT
            Project Manager. These may vary slightly in name specification over the data sets, but each role accurately
            represents the main aspects of what the groups' position was described in both general and ICT skill sets
            required for the positions.

            <p>Only a few of our combined general skills were not listed as those in greatest demand, including;
                adaptability, domain knowledge, prioritizing, and a thirst for learning. These skills may not have been
                listed as they are more implied skills to specific fields that those specified, or they are implied to
                be a skill in combination with one of the general skills listed. However, they are still important
                skills to develop oneself and succeed in a working environment.

            <h4>What are the three highest-ranked IT-specific skills which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
            <p>The following two skills were the only not listed as a part of our combined IT skills set, including
                their relative position in ranking:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>6th.	SAP (2,189)</li>
                <li>7th.	Business Management (2,141)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>SAP (System Applications and Products in Data Processing) was not listed as one of our combined IT skills
                as it is a very specific software practice used in businesses to combine all operations and processes
                for successful exchanges of data and information within the business. Knowledge and use of this system
                falls under Business Management type roles that involve supervision and management of business within a
                company that includes operations, employee management, and assets, which none of our group members were
                striving for and thus explains why Business Management was also not a skill in our skill set.
            </p>
            <h4>What are the three highest-ranked general skills which are not in your required skill set?</h4>
            <p>
                There are many other general skills that contribute to a well-rounded and efficient professional but on
                the basis of the provided Burning glass data none of the stated general skills listed were missing from
                the general skill set of our group. This is due to the fact that the abilities displayed in each of our
                job titles are distinct enough to their own fields’ individual talents and requirements to when
                combined, nearly completely reflect the skills data from Burning Glass Baseline.
