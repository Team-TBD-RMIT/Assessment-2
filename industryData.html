        <p>
            Our teams’ ideal jobs offered quite the variation and each with a unique vision for their future careers.
            The job titles were as follows: Machine Learning Researcher, Senior Project Manager, Front End Web
            Developer, and two Software Engineers. As some of these roles are more specialized positions that didn’t
            offer many useful data that could accurately be portrayed in the Burning Glass Data and other data
            resources, they were categorized into four umbrella Job Titles: Software Engineer, Web Developer, and IT
            Project Manager. These may vary slightly in name specification over the data sets, but each role accurately
            represents the main aspects of what the groups' position was described in both general and ICT skill sets
            required for the positions.
