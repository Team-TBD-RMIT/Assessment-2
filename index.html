                outstanding assessment 2 and 3 for Introduction to IT, working together on a project that if it was to

            <h3>What does TBD Stand for?</h3>
            <p>It stands for to be decided. </p>
            <h3>Why To be Decided?</h3>
            <p>TBecause like the future our potential is boundless, the possibilities endless and we do not want to be
                limited to a singular idea. TBD stand for much than just to be decided, it stands for: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Tenacity – We are a determined team who strive to be at the forefront of technology and how
                        it can benefit humanity
                    </li>
                    <li>Belief – We are believers of a better world; a better society and we believe that is possible
                        through the innovation of technology
                    </li>
                    <li>Discovery – We're discoverers of tomorrow's innovations today, through the exploration of
                        technologies and the furthering of our studies
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p>Tomorrow’s discoveries are yet to happen. The future is TBD.</p>

                <p>My name is Bronagh Falloon, I am of British descent, and my family came over to Australia when I was
                    just 1 year old from New Zealand, being granted Australian citizenship in 2014. I got a Certificate
                    IV in health care, studied nursing for 2 years and I now work at Factory Blinds making hollands.
                    One odd hobby I have is learning about personality systems and the categorization of these traits.
                    I have spent many hours learning the MBTI (Myers Briggs Type Indicator) personality inventory and
                    then I learned about Jungian cognitive functions which in the context of MBTI are the extroverted
                    or introverted versions of Feeling, Thinking, Sensing, and Intuitive. A few years ago, a YouTuber
                    came out with an expanded system that came from the MBTI inventory called objective personality
                    types, which contains 512 types that I have spent over a hundred hours learning. </p>

                <p>My name is Meg Maroni, and I am apart of Team TBD. I was born and have lived majority of my life in
                    Albany, a stunning coastal city in Western Australia, which boast a wealth of hiking trails,
                    wildlife, and bush tracks that I enjoy taking advantage of in my leisure time. Here, I also finished
                    my K-12 education and received my TAFE (technical and further education) credentials, earning my
                    highest certificate – a Cert IV in Information and Technology – in 2020.

                    I am honoured to have been named the 2020 Vocational Student of the Year by the Apex Club of Albany,
                    and one of the 2020 Southern Regional TAFE Students of the year throughout the 12 campuses in the
                    Great Southern Region in appreciation of my academic achievements. My current position as a
                    Technical Support Officer for two primary schools and one secondary school in my area has given me
                    extensive experience in managing, maintaining, and fixing the physical technological infrastructure
                    and networking of medium-sized organisations.

                <p>Highest Education: Cert IV in IT networking (2006)</p>
                <p>Born 1989 in Sydney, Australia. I was released onto this world alongside The Simpsons and the release
                    of Gameboy in Japan and North America. I have lived predominately in the outer Western Suburbs of
                    Sydney in a region called the Hawkesbury. I currently both work and study IT.
                    Outside of work and study, I live a rather simple and peaceful life. My most notable interest, to me
                    at least would be Sci-fi. I love all things Sci-Fi including games, movies, shows, etc. I think it
                    may be fairer to say I love all things space-related in general. On clear nights I love looking up
                    at the night sky and gazing across the stars imagining the possibilities, similarly to IT. What
                    draws me to it is the vastness of space, the unknown, and the possibilities. I believe in a brighter
                    future for humanity, and I believe to get to that brighter future, we need to look to technology,
                    and we need to look to space.

                <p>My name is Patrick, and I am an Australian-born Filipino raised in Sydney, NSW Australia.
                    I have a Certificate III in Information Technology (Networking) which I obtained in 2007 and I am
                    currently taking online courses at RMIT with the goal of completing the Bachelor of Information
                    Technology or possibly looking at entry to Bachelor of Software Engineering through transfer after
                    completing first year subjects.

                    I enjoy riding motorbikes when it’s warm and snowboarding when it’s cold. Lately I’ve been exploring
                    and learning how to build applications by implementing a range of open-source software. I have
                    learned that there is a lot of moving parts and technologies involved when constructing an
                    application so when the parts eventually start working together it is deeply satisfying.

                <p>My name is Malachi Cleland, and I was born and raised in rural Australia where I still live today.
                    I am looking toward moving to Melbourne in the near future, having lived there for almost two years
                    in the past in which I almost completed an advanced diploma degree.
                    Hobbies I love include writing and drawing. I haven't drawn in a while actually, but pencil is my
                    medium of choice as I am a bit of an art snob/purist with an opinion using a tablet and stylist is
                    a bit of an easy route to art. It’s something about seeing my imagination forged that really
                    satisfies my desires. Most of the time I’m not interested in technologies or gaming consoles, I
                    will be reading my heart out.

                    I learned Indonesian in my high school years, many moons ago. Though it’s instilled a desire to
                    learn plenty of languages since (German at the top of the list). On the list of jobs I would love
                    to have is a translator, because bridging down language barriers to bringing people together is a
                    beautiful thing, in my opinion. Plus, if you do what you love you never call it work, right?
